# 'Nata's Backend Service

## What does the project do?

This service serves endpoints related to the 'Nata' project. No frontend is being provided by this application. This application receives and processes requests that will eventually be sent out by the frontend once this exists.  
These endpoints use REST and will manage (CRUD) entities like establishments, reviews, comments, reactions and user accounts.
